# Errata

Errors are listed by chapter, followed by page number.

## Chapter 1

Page 35: Figure 1.13 is incorrectly labeled a Mercator projection.  It's actually an Equirectangular projection (also known in WCS as a "Cartesian projection")

## Chapter 2

Page 47/50: there are eight entries despite the title "Seven Strategies..."

Page 60: Eq. (2.7), "less than" sign should be "greater than"

## Chapter 3

Page 76: in Figure 3.3, the (1,1) and (2,2) cells are erroneously switched.

Page 99: The line below eq. (3.60) should say "Note that for k = 1 this distribution is a Cauchy distribution", not "k = 2"

## Chapter 4

Page 126: The denominator of the argument of the exponential of Eq. (4.2) should be sigma squared, not sigma, to better match Eq. (3.43) and lead to Eq. (4.4).

Page 130: The denominator of the argument of the exponential of Eq. (4.11) should be sigma squared, not sigma, to better match Eq. (3.43) and lead to Eq. (4.13).


## Chapter 5



## Chapter 6



## Chapter 7



## Chapter 8



## Chapter 9



## Chapter 10

Page 427: in the first paragraph of section 10.3.1, it should be
         omega = 2 pi f = 2 pi / P, and not (2 pi P) for the last part.

Page 437: figure 10.15: in the creation of this figure, the noise was not applied
to the data before computing the periodogram.  See a fuller discussion along
with an updated figure on the
[astroML website](http://www.astroml.org/book_figures/chapter10/fig_LS_sg_comparison.html)



## Appendix

### Appendix A

### Appendix B

### Appendix C

Page 517:  The final paragraph of section C.3 should mention that SDSS does not
use Pogson magnitudes as defined in Equation C.2, but rather the asinh
magnitudes defined by [Lupton, Gunn & Szalay (1999)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AJ....118.1406L).
See also http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/magnitudes.php.

In addition, the SDSS magnitude system is *almost* but not *exactly* on the
AB system.  There are ~1% differences.  Again, see http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/magnitudes.php.
