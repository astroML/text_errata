# Errata

Errors are listed by chapter, followed by page number.

## Chapter 1

Page 35: Figure 1.13 is incorrectly labeled a Mercator projection.  It's actually an Equirectangular projection (also known in WCS as a "Cartesian projection")

## Chapter 2

Page 49: Second footnote of hadoop.apache.org?

Page 60: Eq. (2.7) less than sign should be greater than??





## Chapter 3

Page 76: in Figure 3.3, the (1,1) and (2,2) cells are erroneously switched.

Page 99: The line below eq. (3.60) should say "Note that for k = 1 this distribution is a Cauchy distribution", not "k = 2"

## Chapter 4

Page 126: The denominator of the argument of the exponential of Eq. (4.2) should be sigma squared, not sigma, to better match Eq. (3.43) and lead to Eq. (4.4).

Page 130: The denominator of the argument of the exponential of Eq. (4.11) should be sigma squared, not sigma, to better match Eq. (3.43) and lead to Eq. (4.13).
