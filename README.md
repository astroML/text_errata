# Errata

Errors are listed by chapter, followed by page number.

## Chapter 1

Page 19 (also, Figure 1.2 on Page 21): The function `fetch_sdss_spectrum()`
does not, in fact, query any database in real time.  It simply retrieves a
specific file from the SDSS-I/II Data Archive Server (DAS) via http.

Page 35: Figure 1.13 is incorrectly labeled a Mercator projection.  It's actually an Equirectangular projection (also known in WCS as a "Cartesian projection")

## Chapter 2

Page 47/50: there are eight entries despite the title "Seven Strategies..."

Page 60: Eq. (2.7), "less than" sign should be "greater than"

## Chapter 3

Page 76: in Figure 3.3, the (1,1) and (2,2) cells are erroneously switched.

Page 95: in the Python code preamble 'is implemented in "scipy.stats.cauchy"' should be replaced with "scipy.stats.laplace"

Page 99: The line below Eq. (3.60) should say "Note that for k = 1 this distribution is a Cauchy distribution", not "k = 2"

Page 109: The first sentence in the paragraph preceeding Eq. (3.78) should read
"If sigma_xy=0, then x and y are uncorrelated, and if also independent, we can
treat them separately as two one-dimensional distributions." (that is, vanishing
correlation does not necessarily imply independence)


## Chapter 4

Page 126: The denominator of the argument of the exponential of Eq. (4.2) should be sigma squared, not sigma, to better match Eq. (3.43) and lead to Eq. (4.4).

Page 130: The denominator of the argument of the exponential of Eq. (4.11) should be sigma squared, not sigma, to better match Eq. (3.43) and lead to Eq. (4.13).


## Chapter 5

Page 183: In Equation (5.17), the argument for the last exp is missing a minus sign. 

Page 188: In Equation (5.27) the labels of M should be swapped.  The correct
equation is O_{21} = p(D|M_2)/p(D|M_1).

Page 221: In the sentence immediately preceding Eq. (5.100) the words 'and mu' should not be there.

Page 225: In Equation (5.107) there is an erroneous repeated end parenthesis on the left hand side of the equation.

Page 234: In the sample Python code, the sigma in the pymc.Normal command should be replaced with 1./sigma**2.


## Chapter 6



## Chapter 7

Page 309: In the gray box, the simulated data uses 1000 points in 2 dimensions, but the comments refer to 100 points in two dimensions.

## Chapter 8

Page 339: Typo on line 7, "that" should be replaced by "than" in the sentence 
"...the bandwidth is more important that the exact shape..."

Page 357: In Equation 8.77 and 8.78 the term in square brackets should be squared. 

Page 357: In Equation 8.77 and 8.78 the term in square brackets should be squared. 

## Chapter 9



## Chapter 10

Page 427: in the first paragraph of section 10.3.1, it should be
         omega = 2 pi f = 2 pi / P, and not (2 pi P) for the last part.

Page 437: figure 10.15: in the creation of this figure, the noise was not applied
to the data before computing the periodogram.  See a more detailed discussion along
with an updated figure on the
[astroML website](http://www.astroml.org/book_figures/chapter10/fig_LS_sg_comparison.html)



## Appendix

### Appendix A

### Appendix B

### Appendix C

Page 517:  The final paragraph of section C.3 should mention that SDSS does not
use Pogson magnitudes as defined in Equation C.2, but rather the asinh
magnitudes, see http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/magnitudes.php#asinh.

Page 517: The SDSS magnitude system deviates from a perfect AB system by 0.01-0.02 mags.
See http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/fluxcal.php#SDSStoAB.

### Appendix D

Page 519: This query has to be submitted within a particular context within CasJobs,
specifically DR8 or higher (DR7 does not have the value-added spectral information).

Page 519: The astrometric corrections of DR9 have not been applied to this query.
This affects the columns `G.ra` and `G.dec`. An additional join on the
`AstromDR9` table is necessary to get the correct astrometry (errors are <0.5 arcsec).
See also http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/imaging/caveats.php#astrometry.

Page 519: The URL in the footnote is incorrect and it should be
http://skyserver.sdss3.org/casjobs/ (only the SDSS-III CasJobs site contains DR8 and higher
data).


### Appendix E


### Index

Page 537: For entry MAP, a reference to page 179 should also be listed because MAP
is defined at that page (see bullet 4).
